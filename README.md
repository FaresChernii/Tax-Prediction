# Tax-Prediction
The Tax Problem Predictor is a web application that uses machine learning and natural language processing to assess tax problems for companies and provide recommendations. This tool predicts whether a company is likely to face tax issues based on various financial and operational inputs. It also generates detailed recommendations for mitigating potential tax problems.
## Getting Started
Before running the Tax Problem Predictor web application, you need to set up the required environment and provide the necessary configuration.
### Installation
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- **Flask**: Install using `pip install Flask`
- **Joblib**: Install using `pip install joblib`
- **Pandas**: Install using `pip install pandas`
- **OpenAI GPT-3**: You will need an API key from OpenAI to use the natural language processing capabilities. Replace the placeholder `api_key = 'enter-your-api-key'` in the `app.py` file with your actual API key.
### Usage
1. Update the API key and other configurations in the app.py file:
- Replace `api_key = 'enter-your-api-key'` with your OpenAI GPT-3 API key.
2. Run the web application:
- python app.py
3. Access the web application by opening a web browser and navigating to http://localhost:5000.
  
4. Use the web form to input company information and assess tax problems. The application will predict whether a tax problem is likely and provide recommendations.
### Folder Structure 
- `static`: Contains the CSS styles used for the web interface.
- `templates`: Contains HTML templates for the web pages (`index.html` and `result.html`).
- `WorkingDB.csv`: Placeholder for working data (not included in the repository).
- `app.py`: The main Python script for running the Flask web application.
- `model.py`: Contains code related to machine learning model training and predictions.
- `model_columns.pkl`: Pickle file with model column information.
- `test.py`: Placeholder for testing (not included in the repository).
- `trained_rf_model.pkl`: Pickle file containing the trained random forest model.
 ## Dataset 
 Contains 100 examples (50 with tax problem and 50 without tax problem) including 70 examples for training and 30 examples for testing 
 ### Dataset explanation 
 Here are explanations for each of the columns in the dataset:
- `entreprise_id` - Unique identifier for each company
- `industrie` - Industry sector the company operates in
- `chiffre_affaires` - Total annual revenue generated by the company (in thousands of dollars)
- `dépenses` - Total annual expenses incurred by the company (in thousands of dollars)
- `employés` - Number of employees working at the company
- `catégorie_d'actifs` - Classification of a capital asset owned by the company (building, equipment, vehicle, land)
- `valeur_d'actifs` - Original purchase value of the capital asset (in thousands of dollars)
- `âge_d'actifs` - Number of years since the capital asset was 
- `imposition_supplémentaire_évaluée` - Additional taxes owed after an audit (in thousands of dollars)
- `créances_irrécouvrables` - Bad debt from uncollectible accounts receivable written off (in thousands of dollars)
- `difficulté_fiscale` - Target variable, 1 if company had a tax issue, 0 if not
- `type_de_donnée` - Indicates if example is for training or testing the model
## Model 
Random Forest Classifier with one-hot encoding
